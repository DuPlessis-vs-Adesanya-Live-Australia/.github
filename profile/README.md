Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) returns to the pay-per-view (PPV) market later TONIGHT (Sat., Aug. 17, 2024) on ESPN+ from inside RAC Arena in Perth, western Australia. Headlining the event is a bad blood Middleweight title fight between division champion, Dricus Du Plessis, and former 185-pound kingpin, Israel Adesanya. In UFC 305’s co-main event, Kai Kara-France takes on Steve Erceg in a Flyweight battle, while Mateusz Gamrot locks horns with Dan Hooker one fight prior in a Lightweight firecracker. Rounding out UFC 305’s PPV main card are fun showdown between Tai Tuivasa vs. Jairzinho Rozenstruik and Li Jingliang vs. Carlos Prates.
Du Plessis earned a title fight against Adesanya not too long ago after defeating Robert Whittaker at UFC 290, but then shocked the combat world after declining the fight to take some time off to get his body right (or go on vacation). Stepping in his place was Sean Strickland, who pulled off one of the greatest upsets by defeating “The Last Stylebender” via dominant unanimous decision. Four months later, “DDP” dethroned “Tarzan,” setting up a long-awaited showdown against Adesanya. Currently on a nine-fight win streak — seven under the UFC banner — “Stillknocks” is out to earn his first-ever title defense to solidify his champion status.
